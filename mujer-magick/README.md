# Mujer Magick

Easy/Quickly  to use ImageMagick (using wasm-imagemagick) with node.js and browser API and command Line interface.

It includes wasm binaries from [wasm-imagemagick](https://github.com/KnicKnic/WASM-ImageMagick) so with just npm install you are ready to go. 

Status

I really need a node.js command line interface quickly so That's is why I'm doing this. 

magick files can be generated from that project executing npm run test-node


## TODO

- [ ] npm test js is failing
